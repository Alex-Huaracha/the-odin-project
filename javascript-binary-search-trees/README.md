# JavaScript Binary Search Tree

Simple balanced Binary Search Tree implementation (build, insert, delete, find, traversals, height, depth, balance check and rebalance).

This project is part of the The Odin Project curriculum.

## Features

- Build a balanced BST from an array (removes duplicates, sorts).
- Insert and delete values (handles leaf / one child / two children).
- Find nodes.
- Traversals: level-order, in-order, pre-order, post-order.
- height(value) and depth(value).
- isBalanced() and rebalance().

## Quick start

1. Install Node.js (v20+ recommended).
2. From project root:
   - Run demo: `node main.js`

## Notes

- Duplicates are removed on initial build; insert rejects duplicates.
- Use `main.js` to run a simple driver/demo that prints traversals and pretty-prints the tree.
