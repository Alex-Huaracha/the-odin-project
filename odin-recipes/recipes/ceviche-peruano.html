      This ceviche is the best you will ever have. It is from Peru and I love

      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>
          Place the potatoes and sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with
          water. Simmer until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, then
          drain, and set aside to cool to room temperature. Place the sliced
          onion in a bowl of warm water, let stand 10 minutes, then drain and
          set aside.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, place the lime juice, celery, cilantro, and cumin into the
          bowl of a blender, and puree until smooth. Pour this mixture into a
          large glass bowl, and stir in the garlic and habanero pepper. Season
          with salt and pepper, then stir in the diced tilapia and shrimp.
        </p>

        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>
          Set aside to marinate for an hour, stirring occasionally. The seafood
          is done once it turns firm and opaque.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          To serve, peel the potatoes and cut into slices. Stir the onions into
          the fish mixture. Line serving bowls with lettuce leaves. Spoon the
          ceviche with its juice into the bowls and garnish with slices of
          potato.
