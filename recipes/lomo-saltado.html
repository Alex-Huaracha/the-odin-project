      This lomo saltado recipe is a traditional and very easy dish to make. I
      might add that it's also very popular with finicky kids and adults.

    <ol class="list steps">
      <li>
        <strong>Step 1</strong>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 2</strong>
        <p>
          Arrange frozen French fries in a single layer on an ungreased cookie
          sheet.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 3</strong>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until light golden, 22 to 24 minutes.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 4</strong>
        <p>
          Meanwhile, heat 2 tablespoons oil in a frying pan over medium-high
          heat. Season sliced beef with salt and pepper. Cook and stir beef in
          hot oil until just cooked and the juices release. Use a slotted spoon
          to transfer beef to a plate.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 5</strong>
        <p>
          Cook and stir onions in beef drippings in the pan until translucent, 3
          to 4 minutes. Stir in tomato and aji amarillo; cook until tomato
          softens. Pour in vinegar and soy sauce.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Step 6</strong>
        <p>
          Add French fries and beef to the pan. Cover and cook until beef is
          cooked through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt and pepper; sprinkle
          with chopped parsley to serve.
        </p>
